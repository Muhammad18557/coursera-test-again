	<h1> Simple selectors (h1 tag) </h1>
	<h2> Subheading 2 that we styled using element selector with color:red and text-align:center </h2>

	<p class="highlight"> 
		A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single topic. Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs. An example is as follows: <br> 
		"There are many different kinds of animals that live in China. 2 Tigers and leopards are animals that live in China's forests in the north. 2 In the jungles, monkeys swing in the trees, and elephants walk through the brush. The cities in China are filled with millions of people. 2 There are camels in the deserts in China that people use for transportation. 3 Lots of different kinds of animals make their home in China."
	<h2> Subheading 2 again </h2>
	<p> This content is also inside p tag but without class = "highlight" this time. This is supposed to be a complete paragraph </p>
	<div>
	This is the main point of the entire lecture. So, attribute <span id="mainPoint"> id="mainPoint".</span>
	</div>
