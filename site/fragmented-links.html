    <h3> MODERN SOCIAL THOUGHT </h3>
    <p>
    This is the first section and it talks about my first course for the next semester, Modern Social Thought. This course has one midterm project and one final paper. It might as well have presentation(s). This course is part of our common curriculum, meaning that all students have to take this course for sure in their sophomore year at college.

    <h3> PROGRAMMING FOR DATA SCIENCE </h3>
    <p>
     This is the third section and it talks about my third course for the next semester, Programming for Data Science. The syllabus says that "we use a programming language (Python) to look at the design and implementation of algorithms that are relevant to Data Science tasks. This class will guide you to learn some practical tools. The students should expect to spend 5 - 10 hours on programming per week during the semester. We will also cover some useful topics to help students understand how these tools are deployed in real-world applications."
