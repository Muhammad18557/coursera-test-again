    We can link to a file in the same directory as this HTML file like this:
    <a href = "lists.html" title="same dir link"> 
        Linking to the file lists.html in the same directory </a>

    <a href = "lists.html" title="same dir link"> 
        <div> DIV Linking to the file lists.html in the same directory </div>
    </a>
